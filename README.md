# [d]ecyph

Basically, *Decyph* is a tiny tool that I made when solving *the Gostak*.

**Implemented features:**

- Push entries (into the dictionary)
  - Example: `push gostak`
  - Batch push
- Remove entries (into the dictionary)
  - Example: `remove gostak`
  - Batch remove
- Morph entries (make morphs of a word)
  - Example: `morph gostak gostaks`
  - Unmorph entry
- Link entries
  - Example: `link gostak dosh`
  - Unlink entries
- Translation
  - Example: `translate The gostak distims the doshes.`
  - Show word information if there is only one word in the sentence, and that the word can be translated
- Save / Load dictionary data



**Features in absurd imagination** (would very probably never come into existence)**:**

- Untranslation
- Print dictionary list
- Search (fuzzy search?)
- Make morphs hold variated translations (defaults to the same translation as the original form)
- Make notes about an entry (notes should be shown on word info)
- Part of speech (nah, this is too hard)
